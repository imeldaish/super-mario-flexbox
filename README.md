Welcome to the Flex-Box Practice website for the Web Developer Camp at iCode Cypress! This website is designed to help kids registered for the camp practice their flex-box skills using HTML and CSS.

<h1> Description </h1>

The Flex-Box Practice website provides students with a "broken" version of a website that needs to be fixed. The website contains HTML and CSS files. Students will be given a CSS file with some of the flex-box elements removed. Their task is to replace the comments in the CSS file with their own flex-box CSS properties, such as flex-direction and justify-content, to orient specific elements and make their website look like the finished version.

The project includes two main files:

<ul>
  <li>index.html: This file contains the HTML structure of the website. Students will not need to modify this file for the exercise.</li>
  <li>styles.css: This file contains the broken CSS code that needs to be fixed by the students. It will be provided to them as a starting point.
  Additionally, there is a completed-styles.css file included, which serves as an example of what the finished version should look like. The instructor can use this file to showcase     the expected outcome to the students by editing the link tag in the html file.</li>
</ul>
