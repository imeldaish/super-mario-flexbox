# super-mario-flexbox

Welcome to the Flex-Box Practice website for the Web Developer Camp at iCode Cypress! This website is designed to help kids registered for the camp practice their flex-box skills using HTML and CSS.

The Flex-Box Practice website provides students with a "broken" version of a website that needs to be fixed. The website contains HTML and CSS files. Students will be given a CSS file with some of the flex-box elements removed. Their task is to replace the comments in the CSS file with their own flex-box CSS properties, such as flex-direction and justify-content, to orient specific elements and make their website look like the finished version.

The project includes two main files:

index.html: This file contains the HTML structure of the website. Students will not need to modify this file for the exercise.
styles.css: This file contains the broken CSS code that needs to be fixed by the students. It will be provided to them as a starting point.
Additionally, there is a completed-styles.css file included, which serves as an example of what the finished version should look like. The instructor can use this file to showcase the expected outcome to the students by editing the link tag in the html file.

Getting Started
To get started with the Flex-Box Practice website, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
Open the styles.css file.
Review the code and identify the comments that need to be replaced with flex-box CSS properties.
Replace the comments with appropriate flex-box CSS properties to fix the broken website and make it resemble the finished version.
Save the styles.css file.
Open the index.html file in a web browser to see the updated website.

If you need assistance with flex-box properties or HTML/CSS syntax, refer to the following resources:
